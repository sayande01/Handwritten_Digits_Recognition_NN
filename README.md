Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition System Using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV Neural Networks

Workflow -

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the MNIST dataset containing handwritten digit samples.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1 to enhance model performance and convergence during training.

2. **Model Architecture Design:**
   - Create a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Design the model architecture:
     - Include a flattened input layer to accept the pixel values of the digit images.
     - Add two dense hidden layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns in the data.
     - Incorporate a dense output layer with softmax activation to classify the digits into ten categories (0 to 9).

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Compile the model, specifying the optimizer as 'adam' and the loss function as 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'.
   - Train the model on the training dataset for a predefined number of epochs.
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing dataset to calculate metrics such as loss and accuracy.

4. **Model Saving and Loading:**
   - Implement functionality to save the trained model to disk as 'handwritten_digits.model' for future use.
   - Provide the option to load the pre-trained model from disk if available, allowing for inference on new data without retraining.

5. **Custom Image Prediction:**
   - Develop functionality to load custom images containing handwritten digits.
   - Preprocess the custom images to ensure compatibility with the model input format.
   - Utilize the trained model to predict the digit represented by each custom image.
   - Visualize the predicted digit alongside the original image using matplotlib.

6. **Error Handling and Robustness:**
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during image loading, preprocessing, and prediction.
   - Ensure the system's reliability by addressing potential issues such as incorrect image paths or corrupted image files.

By accomplishing these detailed objectives, the Handwritten Digits Recognition system aims to provide a comprehensive solution for accurately recognizing handwritten digits, catering to both training on standard datasets like MNIST and inference on custom images.
